    <h3>How do I approach a project</h3>
    <p>Is this a problem of usability, navigation, or customer satisfaction?
        With a qualitative background, it is important to understand users' needs and motivations. This can be done
        through interviews or focus groups.
        If it is a qualitative issue, we could measure satisfaction through surveys, and data analysis</p>

    <h3> Resources and limitations</h3>
    <p>Do we have a big research team, do we have enough time and budget? With a big team, we can conduct exhaustive
        studies, but if we don't, a micro survey could do the job.</p>

    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p> What is the stage in the development cycle of the product?</p>

    <h3>Users</h3>
    <p> Are they experts in the field, what is their tech literacy level? What do they need? We can answer these
        questions through usability tests with them, empathy maps, etc.</p>

    <h3>Flexibility</h3>
    <p>A mix of various methods or approaches could work, this is the perfect time to get creative!</p>
